<p>Subhash Chandra ought to be biting his nails. The BCCI refused his bid for TV rights, and he took it badly. Just to hurt BCCI, he decided to start the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). Not taking away anything from ICL, it cannot be compared to the two weeks of entertainment galas we had since the start of IPL.  It was all happening out there in the jam-packed stadiums - from loud entertaining music to dancing cheerleaders to firecrackers to live performances and not to forget some exciting cricket.</p>

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><strong>WE HAD THE COMMENTS FROM ARJUNA RANATUNGA COMPARING <br />IPL TO THREE MINUTE NOODLES (YAHOO/NEWS)</strong></p> 
<p align="left" style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>IPL with its advent had its share of controversies. Firstly, it was Cricket Australia complaining about the security in India. Then it was the ICC (International Cricket Council), <img class="image-right" src="../../sreesanth_ponting.PNG/image_mini" alt="pic1_ipl" height="165" width="200" />who were undecided if they like or hate the IPL. To add to this, there were a whole bunch of issues with Ponting and Symonds (probably because of the rather large difference in their pay packets). Initially, we had comments from Arjuna Ranatunga comparing IPL to three minute noodles, although the next day Ranatunga granted the Lankans permission to play in the IPL, and even suggested pushing forward Pakistan's tour to accommodate <img class="image-right" src="../../copy_of_sreesanth_weep.PNG/image_mini" alt="sreeipl" height="163" width="200" />the IPL. Then we found out that Bal Thackrey doesn't like the IPL and that the Left parties in the central government wanted the CBI to investigate

the IPL for corruption charges.</p>

<p>The drama continued with the organizers 'hitting' India's ace spinner Harbhajan Singh with an 11-match ban and a fine of approx. Rs.3 crore, following complaints by the Mohali team that Singh had, in a fit of anger, slapped his teammate S. Sreesanth. According to media reports, both Shah Rukh and Sourav had fallen apart on several issues including team selection and also on Coach John Buchanan being given more power by the owner in running the team. Kolkata Knight Rider's chief executive Joy Bhattacharya later rubbished rumours of a reported rift between team owner Shah Rukh Khan and Captain Sourav Ganguly.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The cheerleaders provided their share of entertainment in their skimpy outfits. The controversy started with concerns from some political leaders of Maharashtra, it is against the culture of India to watch cheerleaders perform during matches said some of them, and this fire of controversy spread rapidly and reached West Bengal too. Then all the political parties of the country decided to make full utilization of this controversy for their political interest.</p> 
<p align="center"><strong>"THERE ARE MORE U.S.-DOLLAR MILLIONAIRES IN THIS COUNTRY THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE OF AUSTRALIA PONTING... (INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TIMES)"</strong></p> 
<p>Amidst these controversies some good cricket was also been played. Many of the <img class="image-right" src="../../copy2_of_copy_of_underdog.PNG/image_mini" alt="underdog2" height="210" width="195" />matches went down to the wire. The Twenty20 format guaranteed some real entertainment. For people who saw cricket only in the 9:00 pm news this was the perfect format. In the end I thought the best teams reached the finals and the deserving one won the tournament. In one of the ultimate climax, unlike the two semi-finals of DLF the Indian Premier League, the Rajasthan Royals emerged victorious with a thrilling three-wicket victory over Chennai Super Kings on the very last ball. In the end it was a memorable win for the team that started its journey as an underdog and as the least expensive franchise in the first ever IPL tournament.</p> 
<p>The first Indian Premier League (IPL) was entitled the richest domestic cricket tournament of the world. The IPL offered a cheque of Rs 4.8 crore to the winner, whereas Rs 12 crore was the complete prize money. In this cash-packed tournament, even the runner up got Rs 2.4 crore, whereas the last paced finisher got Rs 40 lakh.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>"The everyday Australian would have absolutely no idea of the wealth within this country (India)," Ponting said during a photo-shoot in Bangalore There are more U.S.-dollar millionaires in this country than there are people in the whole of Australia".</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But Wadia, like other owners of the IPL teams who have spent m<img class="image-right" src="../../shahrukh.PNG/image_mini" alt="shahrukh2" height="217" width="195" />illions of dollars to own the team and buy the players, will not be seeing millions in a hurry. However, some have already begun hearing their cash registers ringing. Take, for example, liquor baron Vijay Mallya, whose team Royal Challengers succumbed to an embarassing 140 runs defeat having been bowled out for a meagre 82 runs, one should not be surprised to see Mallya smiling at the end of the match. He had roped in two co-sponsors for his team, Reebok and Louis Philippe, for Rs.12-14 crore ($3-3.5 million), managed to sell all the 41,000-plus tickets for the inaugural match and, according to industry estimates, has bagged over Rs.2 crore ($500,000) in the bargain. The biggest money maker however, was Shahrukh Khan's Kolkatta Knight Riders.</p> 
<p>And, among all of these, IPL will stand to be the biggest gainer and will be minting money from the word "go." From advertising rights and broadcasting rights to merchandising rights and franchisee rights, it owns everything the game has to offer and it is charging hefty fees to companies who want a slice of the action. Many, in fact, have criticized IPL organizers, in this regard, as they feel IPL is nothing but a quick way to earn fast money. Hence, it is not surprising to hear cricket gurus say that the long-term success of IPL will depend not on the amount of money made or on the millions earned by the cricketers but on how much the average cricket fan enjoyed.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, stung by the success of IPL, its poorer cousin ICL now wants to get rid of the "rebel" tag. In this regard, they have approached ICC, seeking recognition from the custodians of the game. "We have written to the ICC and have begun dialogues with them," ICL business head, Himanshu Mody, said.</p>
