<p><b><img class="image-left" src="/static/css/images/PRIDE_FC_logo.jpg" alt="pride" height="131" width="200" />Pride</b> in our profession is what keeps us unconditionally motivated in our activities at our work place. On the other hand we develop pride when we feel convinced that it is our professional efforts apart from other things that have lead to excellent results. Thus, our motivation to excel and our pride in our excellence feed on each other to build a fulfilling professional career. Professional pride amongst top achievers is evident in all walks of life. The Making of Samurai Sword (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQqtf86qOc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQqtf86qOc</a>)  shows how for some their chosen profession is more than a passion- it is their spiritual way of life. This clip brings you in an awesome manner what professional pride, process rigour and self discipline is all about. These ten minutes of viewing can change your life. There are many such examples from our own glorious traditions.</p> 
<p>Professional excellence in software development simply translates into <b>consistently</b> <img class="image-right" src="/static/css/images/softwaredevelopment2.jpg" alt="s/w dev" height="182" width="200" />delivering high quality product within the committed time. This does not happen most of the time and we are ready with possible excuses, namely, changing requirements, changing technology, unforeseen circumstances, etc. The trick is to find and adopt the best way to do our activities and follow them without compromise. We can never find the best way if we do not know and define the way we are now doing our activities, if we keep only reacting to the situation and have no clear picture of what we are doing and what is the impact of what we are doing. That is the difference between a novice and a professional. A novice somehow delivers without any method and thinks he or she has mastered the activity while a professional first learns the method, practices it and uses the method to achieve results and based on the results improves both the method itself as also the way he or she executed it.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Rigour</b> is a characteristic of the method we follow. It qualifies how well the method <img class="image-left" src="/static/css/images/Solutions_Manuals_Test_Banks_Exam_Questions_Software.jpg" alt="rigor" height="128" width="109" />has taken care of all eventualities to ensure perfect results. You would have seen the rigorous method of making the Samurai sword. The method takes care of everything to get a perfect sword. All one has to do is to follow it. Technology or the study of techniques or methods precisely does that. It enables us to find out and prove to ourselves that that is the best method for the given situation. Engineering is about building, manufacturing, maintaining the product using the best method provided by technology. We confuse technology and engineering and try to engineer a (software) product without the use of proper technology. While developing a software product we do need to have apriori or before hand knowledge of the techniques or the methods that we are going to follow. Software Development is too complex and made more complex due to its time criticality and does not allow us the luxury of the novice like trial and error approach. Perhaps, we can afford this approach when we are building a dog-house with due apologies to dog lovers but not when we are building a ten-storied building.</p> 
<p>Software development involves solving several types of problems and our human mind is not equipped to handle all of these on the fly. We need to understand the <img class="image-right" src="/static/css/images/cgsignman2.jpg" alt="fix it" height="128" width="117" />intricacies of domain in which the problem is set, work out a solution in terms of the product specifications, We need to analyze the different components that need to be built and understand how they can work together to provide the specified functionality. We then need to translate the functionality of each module into several sequential statements of a programming language. Our thought processes have to tackle great levels of abstraction of the problem domain as well as grapple with minute level details of the computer domain namely the Hardware, the OS, the network, the language, etc.</p> 
<p>Rigour in software development means we need to have a fine blue-print of the methods that would make our efforts easier and safer, a method that would help us channelize our thoughts and let us focus our thoughts on in tackling one aspect at a time. Rigour means that our method does not allow any aspect to go untackled by default and also taking every precaution to prevent or minimize defects.</p> 
<p>In every field whether it is music or sports or construction industry or chemical plants, well understood and universally accepted ways and methods exist. These accepted ways or traditions or best practices have evolved over a long history of using and improving them. Software development is still comparatively a young field. Before we can evolve, stabilize, train and practice any method or process we are under pressure to learn new domains, new technologies, new methods.  Precisely, due to this, we have a greater personal responsibility in finding and adopting personal methods and processes that are rigorous enough and work best for us. We have to be very systematic at a personal level, test our product to see all defects are removed before we hand over to the testing team to validate our product, have clear unit test plans before we test our code, have detailed design before we write code, and have clear specifications before we design our program. To do all these systematically, we need to have a plan that lists the tasks that we are going to perform and a schedule for performing them.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Discipline</b> is the characteristic of our mental strength to stick to our chosen method <img class="image-left" src="/static/css/images/softwareoutsourcing.png" alt="s/w fit ins" height="200" width="200" />and execute it without compromise. We should have adopted either out of our own understanding or due to available knowledge a defined and rigorous method or process to follow. A strong self discipline helps us to stick to it and reap the benefits. Discipline is needed to fight temptations that lead us to assess incorrectly about our own intellectual abilities or the complexity of the task at hand. We yield to temptations of short term gains that actually lead to long term losses. Most methods, strategies, plans and processes fail not because they are not rigorous enough or appropriate enough but because they have not been executed at all or executed haphazardly.</p> 
<p>It is easier for us to discipline ourselves to something about which we are convinced or something that we have been doing systematically for so long that we have internalized those practices sub consciously. However, we will neither be convinced nor internalize any method unless we try them for some time with an open mind. Only when we try can we find out how difficult or easy the method is and how beneficial were they in delivering results. This may call for extra efforts initially to learn new methods or unlearn old habits. This is difficult unless we see results.</p> 
<p>Results can be seen only when we measure at the minimum the size of the product we are building, the efforts we are putting in and the delivered quality in terms of defects. Thus measuring these aspects has to be an integral part of our methods and processes. As soon as we find a defect we need to record them. As soon as we finish an activity like design, or review, or coding we need to note the time we took and keep track of the number of lines of code as our product grows.<img class="image-right" src="/static/css/images/untitled3.bmp/" alt="goals" height="118" width="200" /></p> 
<p>Measurements are great motivators for professional excellence. Your personal easures can justify the pride you feel in yourself and can tell you how good the method or process you are following is and help you set new goals for yourself which you know you can achieve through your disciplined approach.</p>
