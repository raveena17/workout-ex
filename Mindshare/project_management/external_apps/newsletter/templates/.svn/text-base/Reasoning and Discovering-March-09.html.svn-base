<p style="text-align: justify;">In software development life cycle, the web search engines play a major role among programmers. If a particular task is given to a programmer, after understanding the requirement, most of the programmers prefer to search and get the existing code snippets from the internet, more then analyzing and providing the prefect code to match the given requirement. Using the existing code can improve the productivity, but not always. At some instances, an expected program may not be available in the internet, at that time he/she may fail to complete his/her task on time.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">This may not be the right approach always. Let us discuss this with an example. A requirement is to split a decimal number into two pieces, like 56.25 into 56 and 25. The programmer copies the code from internet and it works well. Later, while implementing the product in a client machine, this particular code fails to work. The reason is, in that country (Poland), the decimal numbers are written using comma (56.25 as 56, 25; their style of writing). As we just found, the program found in the internet did not consider internationalization.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lot of open source software components are available over the internet. Many projects under construction use these components as part of their development activity. But no one thinks about the actual code written inside these components (unless customizations are needed). Most of the programmers think, The open source projects are free software components and can reduce development time. Because of this, the old software components replace the invention of new powerful software components.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, if we count the number of programmers who can program without IDE &amp; Search engines, the count will be less. This is because of the lack of coding practice without IDE &amp; Search engines.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Who is a better student? One who learned and passed the exam or the one who copied and passed the exam?</p>
