<p>First of all I would like to thank MIDHUN <img class="image-inline" src="/static/css/images/image001.jpg" alt="Midhun" height="128" width="77" />and BASIL <img class="image-inline" src="/static/css/images/image004.jpg" alt="Basil" height="128" width="107" />for making this trip feel comfortable and joyful for us. Thanks my mallu friends, thanks a ton.</p> 
<p>We were looking forward to this trip for a long time and at last everything fell into place and here I am writing about the ever so memorable sceneries/laugh out loud moments/fun etc etc .</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It was a pleasant Friday evening and we were waiting for the clock to chime 6 O, Clock so that we can wrap up for the day and leave on a merry trip to a land of amiable people and tasty brown fat rice. The train we boarded was "Thiruvanathapuram Express"(rather Trivandram express) which starts at 8 PM on the dot. To everybody's surprise nobody backed out at the last moment and almost 50% of us didn't have any food, probably expecting that central station's food would be great, much to their disappointment, it was awful. Everybody had their "dinner" and even though we booked two months in advance, we were lucky enough to get the S12 coach which was way way back (I can go on with the 'way way back' thing but just 2 ways should give you a better picture). I don't know if it's me or do people like running to their coaches at the last moment? Well anyways, we were sprinting to our coach at 7:59 pm (well most of us)...and tada! We were in our coach; right on time for the train to start .Horns blew and we were off...<b>Kerala here comes 5G.</b></p> 
<p>The train trip: We had a crazy time singing (including those shy enough to sing), shaking a leg or two, playing cards and generally shouting and annoying the other passengers. But our fellow passengers were patient and good enough to understand that we were on a trip and we were patient and good enough to respect our fellow passengers. Before we knew, it was morning (Saturday) and we were in Kerala and boy-o-boy was it a sight to see: the sun rising from the horizon, the extending landscapes, rice fields, cattle grazing in the dew drop covered grasses, the mild mist, small kids in the early hours waving at us- it was an absolute candy for our eyes. So we reached at about +-6:30 at Ernakulam Town. Got down from the train and went straight to the hotel to freshen up and attend Ajay Menon's sister marriage.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Hotel's name--Chakky's (no not chucky the freaky doll but chakky)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The hotel was pretty decent with all the basic amenities provided. So everybody got dressed in their best attires.</p> 
<p> <img class="image-inline" src="/static/css/images/image006.jpg" height="374" width="487" /></p> 
<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>First on the agenda-BREAKFAST</p> 
<p>We were off to Ajay Menon's house cause that's where we were told that the breakfast would be provided and whoosh we were in (hehehe) and to all of our desires, breakfast was served - our first taste of Kerala food- Idly, vadai, sambar and coffee. After breakfast, we were taken to the marriage hall for the wedding ceremony. Before entering the hall we were provided with pineapple juice. We were all very happy to be one of the guests in the happiest day of the bride and the groom. Everything went peachy and we all gave our best poses for the camera with the bridegroom.</p> 
<p>Second on the agenda- LUNCH, and it was absolutely YEAHMMMMMMYY even though we had to wait in a long queue for it (just like people waiting outside the movie halls). I am no gourmet but here are the food items which filled our hungry appetites</p> 
<p>ITEM1--all different kind of curries</p> 
<p>ITEM2-- Solid Fat Brown rice, my favorite</p> 
<p>ITEM3--Sambar, deeelicious</p> 
<p>ITEM4--Rasam, amazing</p> 
<p>ITEM5--Curd, a bit too much on the sour side but was ok</p> 
<p>ITEM6--Payasam, 2 different varieties, Out of the world (I had 1 more extra cup)</p> 
<p>Lunch was done and we gave our best wishes and bid our good byes to the happy couple and thus began our "Roam around Kerala" sessions.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><b>Chapter 1: The Shores of LOVE-Marine Drive</b></p> 
<p> <img class="image-inline" src="/static/css/images/image008.jpg" height="329" width="492" /></p> 
<p> <img class="image-inline" src="/static/css/images/image010.jpg" height="385" width="492" /></p> 
<p>So there we were in the shores of love and romance at 2:30 PM (about 30 mins drive from our hotel) .All of us were in our beach gears, and let me tell you people, the ride in the boat was awesome, wind in your hair and sand at  your feet. We were shown all the best spots in the Lake, like the oil refineries, huge ships (used for scientific studies), patrol boats and some warships. First we were taken to an Island called MATTANCHARY where there was a good chunk of local and foreign population. There were lots of small shops but the prices were not very tempting. The first place we went was to a DUTCH PALACE where the history of Kerala and its rulers was inscribed onto the walls and displayed through some age old artifacts. Next, we went for a stroll in the streets of MATTANCHARY, which were similar to the streets of Italy or Vienna. We had a good long boat ride on the lake. One main attraction was the Chinese fishing nets which were humongous and a great spectacle to watch the fishermen doing what they do best.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><b>Chapter 2: Slumber</b></p> 
<p>We had our dinner and went to sleep (Ahemm!!) J</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><b>Chapter 3: The mighty Falls-ATHIRAMPALLY</b></p> 
<p>Sunday Morning we were woken up by 6-6:30 so that we can reach ATHIRAMPALLY in time to see all the sights and sounds, and it did not disappoint us a bit: ATHIRAMPALLY lived up to our fullest expectations. This was a complete transition from the buzzing city life to a much calm and peaceful place. Some moments captured in time...</p> 
<p><img class="image-inline" src="/static/css/images/image012.jpg" height="308" width="515" /></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>The above picture shows nature at its best. To reach the place we had to trek down a hill, this is actually the best view point one would ever get.</b></p> 
<p> <img class="image-inline" src="/static/css/images/image014.jpg" height="363" width="510" /></p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><b>Splash, Splash, Splash!!! Yeah we all took bath after a Loooong time and it was absolute FUN. This was actually the highlight of the whole trip. Irrespective of the individual's status and position everybody had their say in the pure pristine waters of Athirampalli (festive fun).</b></p> 
<p><b>Next Up: Chapter 4: The Rapids-VAZHACHAL</b></p> 
<p><img class="image-inline" src="/static/css/images/image016.jpg" height="371" width="515" /></p> 
<p>Vazhachal is about 2 km from Athirampalli. Due to lots of tragic deaths which happened in the past, the place was fully barricaded, but the view was breath taking nonetheless (literally Indian Niagara falls).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>After this, one group split and headed to Chennai and the other went for Manju's marriage.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Now here is Ravi giving you his take on the Third day --- J</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Well hold on Nikhil day 2 is not over yet at least for the remaining group!!!</p> 
<p>So, after the first group left, the rest of us (8 guys I think) returned back to the hotel. I started the discussion of doing a road trip to Guruvayoor (famous for the Sanctum sanctorum/ temple). And this took pretty much most of the evening. The discussion would not conclude, as the one thing on everyone's mind was WHEN DO WE EAT? So finally we decided to push off to a nice hotel called Andhra Chillies! As the wonderful dinner progressed and our tummies anger was being pacified, plans for the road trip started shaping up. By the time we finished dinner and reached back to the hotel, it was decided that Sharath, RK, Basil and me would hit the road that night, while the others would crash into bed. It sure was brave and generous of Basil to come along, not just because of a tiring day he had, but also because</p> 
<p>1.      We would be using his brother-in-law's Hyundai Santro.</p> 
<p>2.      He can't enter the temple anyways as non-Hindus are not allowed. (Why are we still in the Stone Age here?)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Back at the hotel, RK informed that he received a call from Gayathri who would also be joining us.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The road trip begins</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Basil arrived with the car and after I had completed my safety checks (head lamps, tail lamps, brake lamps, brakes, etc), Sharath volunteered to drive the car, and so we started off at 11:30 pm. We reached Guruvayoor at 1:30 am and stood in the queue (already 500 m long), while Basil slept in the car park. The darshan started at 3:00 am and we (Gayathri, Sharath, RK and me) completed the darshan and came out of the temple by 4:00 am. We were shocked to find that the queue had grown by another 500 m or more. Everyone was happy to have completed the darshan as planned.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The road trip was very interesting got to see 3 frontal crashes in which there was a good crush to the bumper rails and oops sorry for getting carried away. Anyways the road trip was interesting, especially from the middle of the back seat. I had RK to my left, moving constantly to find a good sleeping position. As for me all along I was wondering WHEN THE HELL IS BASIL GOING TO LET ME DRIVE? On the return journey, we stopped for coffee and then Basil offered me to drive. It turned out that we were only 10 minutes away from the hotel. (Thanks Basil so nice of you.)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Manju's Marriage-</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Back at the hotel, we started preparing for Manju's marriage. Kadal came in by 7:00 am and all the guys who slept in the hotel were fresh and ready. Sharath decided to crash in to bed and laid there like a log. After RK and I got ready, it took a herculean effort to wake this guy up.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>All this while, we thought we were going to be late for the marriage. We wanted to see the main ceremony inside the temple, and everyone thought that it begins at 8:30 am. We started at 9:00 am and reached the temple at 10:00 am. To our surprise, the ceremony was to begin only at 10:30 am. Woohoo!  </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>We got to see the whole ceremony, which lasted only about an hour, and then it was straight to a hotel nearby for the reception. (I like Mallu marriages they come quickly to the point. Jhat pat marriage and then straight to food!)</p> 
<p><img class="image-inline" src="/static/css/images/copy_of_manjusweddingsnap.jpg" alt="Manju's snap" height="386" width="525" /></p> 
<p>Once we had our fill of thick rice (aiyo ramaa!) and washed it down with lots of vellam (water), we then spent some time speaking to Manju and her hubby. Then we headed straight for the Adi Shankaracharya Mutt.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Adi Shankaracharya Matt</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>We reached the Matt at around 2:15 pm and realized that the temple opens to public only at 4:00 pm. So we lazed on the banks of a river running alongside the mutt. Story goes that Shankaracharya was playing in the river and a crocodile grabbed his leg. He told his mom that if she allowed him to become a sanyasi then the crocodile would leave him. And so his mom, who had been strongly against this idea, gave him the permission. The crocodile left his leg immediately. (WHAT?). If you ask me, his mom should have checked if the crocodile was real or not. I did not see a single crocodile in the river there.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Once the temple opened, we moved in and had a nice look around of the pretty place. After that we started our journey back to Aluva station to catch the train. We bought a lot of stuff at Royal Bakery near the station. Petter was so hungry, that he gobbled up a Banana Spilt (huuuge ice-cream).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Back in the train, we all reunited and had a wonderful feast. Post the feast, as most of this group constituted bachelors; we brooded over past girlfriends and tried to seek advice on newer relationships. (As usual pointless discussions after eating a lot of food.)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Next day at 6:30 am we were back in Chennai Central. As usual the excitement of the trip was soon gone when we realized, we have to be in office by 9:00 am (Oh man!). Well all good things must come to an end, but we must remember it is we who have to make it begin again!!!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>So when and where is the next trip????</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Nikhil back again</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Well guys there you go the whole trip debriefed. So, as Ravi has put it, the one question now is WHEN AND WHERE.raring, hoping and praying it would be soon.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This article would not be complete without the dough we spent, so here it is:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Total Trip Costs per head Rs1050 (excluding food expenses)</p> 
<p>Kerala Chips 50 Rs for half a kg</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>CIAO!!</p>
