		<p style="text-align: justify;" class="EC_MsoNormal">The idea of the 5G newsletter conceived in the month of Jan 08. Ananth Seshan summoned me in his chamber and asked me to explore the possibility of publishing a 5G NL. As we all know him - never short of ideas, proposed a bunch of them to me. One of them was - 5G NL should be built on 5G member's thoughts, experiences and ideas. I was saved from doing all the writing!! Wade helped me in listing the interesting topics on which we could invite articles on. I then put together a team of Ram, Shogan and Rajendran.</p> 
		<p style="text-align: justify;" class="EC_MsoNormal"> </p> 
		<p style="text-align: justify;" class="EC_MsoNormal">Work as a team and here you go more innovative ideas. Shogan wanted to have a dedicated 5G blog and Rajendran to build an archive of pictures, videos and other 5G related stuff. Not to fall behind, Ramprasad too came up with an idea which I could not refuse. He wanted to have a separate tab called <strong>Buy &amp; Sell</strong>. You are right if you are thinking that we were inviting trouble. From the idea of few page Newsletter to the idea of a full fledge website kind of thing is way far from normal thinking. The team however was determined so we decided to develop a 5G soft park called as <strong>Mindshare</strong> and host it on 5G server</p> 
		<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> 
		<p style="text-align: justify;">So here you go again. You have one stop park for all sorts of stuff - Entertainment, Articles, Knowledge Sharing, Competitions, Surveys, Campaigns, Blogs and much more. You will however find out most of the above mentioned features are unavailable as of now. There is when <strong>YOU</strong> come into the picture. I want you guys to come forward and take responsibility of developing and maintaining any one area of our park. I assure you that working on this will be <em><strong>time well spent</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p> 
		<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> 
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Many amongst you were not really sure about the kind of articles we are looking for. I will suggest you to read the article "<strong><a title="From the CEO's Desk" class="internal-link" href="from-the-ceos-desk">From the CEO's Desk</a></strong> and you will get your answers. If anyone of you is interested and want to be the editor, or take up the roles of Rajendran, Shogan and Ram for the future editions, you are welcome. The whole idea behind the Mindshare is to rejuvenate our energies and minds.</p> 
		<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> 
		<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to thank Ram, Shogan and Rajendran to bring MindShare to its present form. I promise you all to make other features of the Mindshare functional as soon as possible.</p>
