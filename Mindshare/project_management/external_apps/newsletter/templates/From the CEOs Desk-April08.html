			<p style="text-align: justify;">Greetings and welcome to the inaugural issue of MindShare !</p> 
			<div class="pullquote"><img class="image-inline" src="../../ananthseshan.jpg" height="196" width="207" /></div>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a new beginning with a new hope a hope of building a 5G community for sharing knowledge, ideas and experiences. Some in the community may see this as an opportunity for discussing new technology others to share a customer experience. Some others may wish to express their point of view on a topic that is common to all of us say, like preventative health care, sports, humour, environment, etc.  Regardless, the purpose of this initiative is to understand each other and to learn from each other better, thereby, helping the 5G community as a whole to grow faster! Therefore, may I take this opportunity to welcome each and every member of our community to contribute at least once in a calendar year.  We would like to hear from you and are quite interested in your point of view.</p> 
			<p style="text-align: justify;">As a company, we have always chosen to traverse a path that is different from the rest in our clan. We made this conscious decision not because it will be easy, but knowing fully well that it is going to be hard. The fun is always in flirting with the unknown as Captain Jean Luc Piccard of StarTrek would put it <em>To go where no one has gone before.</em>  It is a good war our collective 5G mind is constantly fighting in order to expand our borders of the known, by capturing slowly, but surely, some territory of the unknown every day.</p> 
			<p style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
			<p style="text-align: justify;">This pursuit requires at least two different types of minds to be present and active in our community those that drive the conventional thinking processes that ensure stability and those that come from left field driving innovation.  One can not establish unequivocally whether stability is more important than innovation or vice-versa since both are needed. Without stability, innovation can not be sustained and stability without innovation will lead us nowhere but to thermal death.  The trick is in achieving the right balance and achieving such a balance is non-trivial since the balance, by nature, is dynamic.</p> 
			<p style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus far, in our journey to date, we have strived to achieve this balance  some times stability has won the battle, and at other times, innovation.  Each one of you who have been associated with 5G for some significant time will be able to recount experiences of many battles fought in this regard. Whether we have struck the right balance thus far is a difficult question to answer but one can definitely say that we have strived sincerely for it right from the beginning.  It is also true that as we move forward we will continue to refine and improve our ability strike such a balance. Regardless, it is important to realize that the very existence of this battle, and therefore, the need for this balance, is a healthy sign towards eroding the unknown.  Careful nurturing of both of these independent types of minds, without static biases or pre-conceived notions, will be of paramount importance.  This will ensure that the struggle keeps going..</p> 
			<p style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
			<p style="text-align: justify;"> Let us fuel this struggle the best we can!</p>
