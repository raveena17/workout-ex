<p><strong>History of Bungee Jumping</strong></p> 
<p>Bungee has quite an old origin. The idea of this way of jumping comes from the ancient ritual "Gkol" performed in the Pentecost Island in the Pacific Archipelago of Vanuatu. The legend says that in the village Bunlap a man called Tamalie had a quarrel with his wife and she ran away and climbed a Banyan tree where she wrapped her ankles with liana vines. When Tamalie came up to her, the woman jumped from the tree and so did her husband not knowing what had his wife done. So he died but the woman survived. The men of Bunlap were very impressed by this performance and they began to practise such jumps in case they got in similar situation. This practice transformed into a ritual for rich yam harvest and also for proving manhood.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Modern bungee jumping as we know it today actually started on the 1st of April ( Fools' Day ) 1979 when group of people from the Oxford University Dangerous Sport Club, impressed by a film about "vine jumpers", jumped from 245-Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England. Using nylon braided, rubber shock cord instead of vines, and dressed in their customary top hat and tails, they performed a four man simultaneous jump .The enthusiasts promptly were arrested for this. But at least hit the world press the next day.</p>

<p><strong>Records:</strong></p> 
<p>The Guinness Book of World Records states the highest commercial bungee jump is off of the Bloukrans River Bridge , 40 kilometres east of Plettenberg Bay in South Africa. This jump takes place from a platform below the roadway of the bridge, and the height from the platform to the valley floor is 216 metres (710 ft). There is another commercial bungee jump currently in operation which claims to be slightly higher, at 220 metres (720 ft). This jump is located near Locarno, Switzerland and takes place from the top of the Verzasca Dam . This jump was prominently featured in the opening scene of the James Bond  film Goldeneye <strong></strong></p>
