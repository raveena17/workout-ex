<p>I cannot understand the current financial crisis, sweeping the world from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean and the Arctic to the Antarctic. At the same time, I am not a finance person, nor do I have some basic education in finance. Still certain fundamental questions remain unanswered. To get to know more about this present situation, I regularly read financial news papers and some times a few articles in the internet but I still cannot understand.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><img class="image-left" src="/static/css/images/dengi.jpg" alt="view point on economy" height="267" width="400" />Let's discuss stock markets from the point of view of my understanding. If I am wrong you are most welcome to correct me.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Assume there is a public limited company called Geliance Metrolium Ltd owned by Mr. Sunil Kambani. The value of the company assets are valued at Rs one Lakh.  Please note: this is not a stock market valuation. If he sells the land, the building, and the machinery separately, at the current market prices he will be getting Rs one Lakh.  Let's assume I have purchased shares from Mr. SK for Rs 1000/- which is one percent of the asset. So I am entitled to a 1% dividend of whatever GM Ltd makes.</p> 
<p>In the current financial year, GM Ltd does business to the tune of Rs 10 Lakhs and makes a profit of Rs one Lakh. Hence, I will be getting Rs 500/- as my dividend after GM ltd saves Rs 50,000/- for rainy day expenses.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But in this world, the above situation remains only in theory. By seeing me earning Rs 1000/- in one year, my neighbor Mr. J will offer Rs 4000/- (a four times higher price) to buy my share. To facilitate such types of trading, stock markets have been created. Stock markets have become a platform to trade stocks of listed companies.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Further to this discussion, Mr. J will buy my share for Rs 4000/- By seeing this transaction, another  friend Mr. K will try to buy the same share at Rs 4500/-. So through all these transactions people are making profits. In due course of time, people will forget GM ltd and concentrate more on trading. Finally, the price of the share will end up at Rs 50000/- after a few months or years. But the actual value of his company might have grown to Rs 2.0 Lakhs taking into account inflation, profit earning, good will etc.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Mr. Sunil Kambani will monitor the market   and will start feeling that he is the owner of an enterprise worth 50 Lakhs. Financial institutions like IBS (Indian Bank of Salaikudi) will also start feeling the same about GM ltd. and will lend the least amount of Rs 25 Lakhs to Mr. SK. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Let us finish the hypothetical arguments here and come back to the current situation. There is no famine in the world to affect the production and generation of wealth. There is no flood, no earth quake or any other natural calamity to affect the world production. There is no major war to destroy assets and human beings. There is no epidemic also. Absolutely nothing has happened to slow down. There is no political turmoil. There is no assassination of world leaders.  <b>But still we are having a crisis covering the entire world. Is it not baffling?<img class="image-right" src="/static/css/images/sensexcrashthumb.jpg" alt="sensex crash" height="171" width="200" /></b></p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p align="left"><b>So what might have happened?</b> There will be a rumor in the market that there is an impending strike about to happen in GM ltd. So people will start selling their stocks. The price of GM ltd. will nose dive to Rs 10,000/- in a period of 3 months. As a result, many of the small investors would have lost heavily to the tune of Rs 40,000/- per share. Mr. SK is poor by Rs 40 Lakhs now. The manager from IBS will approach Mr. SK and ask to settle with at the least, Rs 20 Lakhs within 24 hours. Mr. SK will hand over the keys to IBS and will submit the yellow paper. IBS will take the key and declare GM ltd. as a non performing asset (NPA) and the bank will book a loss of Rs 23 crores after deducting the current asset value of Rs 2 lakhs.  IF IBS does the same for a few more companies, then it has to hand over the key to some one else. This is the reason that most of the financial institutions in the Wall Street had to pull down their shutters.  In this process the stock value of GM ltd. would have touched Rs 1000/- and few more investors would have lost their money.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Assume that the IBS was a little prudent and pragmatic. Instead of following the market, it made an on the spot study of GM ltd and found out that there was nothing wrong, and the business was usual and brisk. It also had a talk with the labor leaders and found out that a new labor outfit with 2% membership had tried to bully the management by going into a strike.  The manager would then retain his investment in GM ltd, and the stock prices might come back to the original level in a few months.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But unfortunately the financial institutions and the small investors are so addicted that they closely monitor and instantly react to the changing figures. They are driven by sentiments, emotions, rumors, impulses, hunches, but least by intelligence. The rating agencies are no exception to this drama. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But even after the crisis, various governments are not creating new financial platforms to help those affected, namely the manufacturing and service sectors. Instead it is refinancing the same institutions who are the root cause of this failure.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If some hawkers can tweak all the figures in the stock market, then the crisis will be over by the next trading session.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So according to me, the whole crisis is imaginary and is based on figures displayed upon computer monitors. <b>Is this the one called Maya in Indian Scriptures?</b> </p>
