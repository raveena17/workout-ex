<p align="left">Three months have already passed by since our first 5G newsletter was published online in Mindshare. And now I welcome you again to our hottest new issue. Here you will get a dose of recent affairs by Ajay Mathew in his coverage of the much hyped and controversial IPL matches and by Kadal Amutham in his analysis of the ongoing Sub-Prime crisis. Also, you are sure to gather some motivational healing in the company of Badri Narayan's inspirational the first step and PVJ's guidance in the focus on completing things. Take a trip to 'Mystifier' if you care to tease your mind with some mind boggling puzzles (by Nanditha Shenoy). Lastly, we have Ravishankar taking us through the recent 5G tour of the green and lush tea estate of Tamil Nadu- Valparai. So, get set and ready to experience a wonderful read!!!</p>

<p>I would like to re-introduce Mindshare as a 5G information gateway. Since its introduction, it has experienced some major enhancements and, as a result of our team's combined efforts, is in the continuous phase of achieving perfection. It received a makeover with a new logo and a new slogan (<i>Together on the same page.</i>). It achieved several new features which are up and running, including a secure access for each 5G employee using his/ her own enterprise username and password. Also, everyone can now have direct access to payIT, 5G Pal, employee contact details etc. Its upcoming improvements, to name a few, are hassle free online leave applications, personal employee profiles etc. It is pleasing to know that a common medium is available for us 5Gites to strive and to make our journey together a success!!!!</p> 
<p align="left" style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
<p align="left" style="text-align: justify;">Again, if anyone is interested in taking up the role of the editor or would like to contribute his/her writing, feel free to join the 5G newsletter team.</p>
